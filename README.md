# Graviton

## Purpose

Graviton is a pure-python, pulse-based pipeline scheduler for querying Rest APIs into generic persistent storage solutions. For its initial major release, the goal will be targeted purely at Sqlite pipelines using pandas DataFrames.

## Usage

## ToDo

1. Rebrand ResponseStrategies to Getters, Putters, and Posters.
2. Decouple Api from ApiImp using a Bridge pattern.
3. Build Endpoints and ParameterDecorators.
4. Configure concrete Endpoints for BittrexEndpointBuilder.
5. Build ApiFactory super and BittrexKit factory to bundle Bittrex Api requirements.
